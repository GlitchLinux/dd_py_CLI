add features to script:

1. when selecting: 4. Format Disk/Partition, list all disks and partitions on disks. allow for formatting whole disks or just partitions on a disk. 

2.  when selecting LUKS as fs type in "4. Format Disk/Partition" start a: "cryptsetup luksFormat (selected disk/partition)" where user is prompted for passphrase to use, also mount the data partiton after luks format and prompt user to select FS type to format it as. 

3. add menu option to create a new virtual disk, prompt user for path where to save it and also the name of the .img. mount virtual disk as read/write. and echo "Virtual disk created at "save path" and mounted as "/dev/loopx"

4. when creating a disk image of a disk. prompt user for path where to save it and then prompt user for a name to save the file as. 

add all these fixes and write out the full edited script.
