changes to make:

1. when selecting 4. 
list disks and partitions numbered like this to allow for formatting a whole disk or a partition on the disk:

list like this:

1. /dev/sda - (name of device and size)
2. /dev/sda1 - (size of partition and fs type)
3. /dev/sda2   - (size of partition and fs type)   
4. /dev/sdb  -  (name of device and size)
5. /dev/sdb1   - (size of partition and fs type)   

user selects number and then is prompted to select fs type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. add new feature to main main menu, "Create new partition". selecting this option script lists disks. user selects disk, script then lists partitions on disk and also any unpartioned free space and prompts user:


1. New partion table and partition - (This prompts user to select MBR or GPT, then user is prompted to select size of partition and FS type.)
2. Create new partition on existing disk (this option allows for creating new partition using free unpartitioned disk space, (this does not format any disk or edits existing partitions - this is for creating new partitions on free disk space.

prompt user: (example)

 /dev/sdx - (device name and size)
FREE SPACE on /dev/sdx 
1. /dev/sdax   - (size of free space and "this free space is before/after /dev/sdax )  
2. /dev/sdax   - (size of free space and "this free space is before/after /dev/sdax )  

user selects free space "slot" and then gets prompted to select partiton size and fs type.


add all these fixes and write out the full edited script.
